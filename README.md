# Mentorship Program Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Mentorship Program Projects Repository with @Olawoyin007 as my mentor. This repository will document all the projects I will be working on during my 6-month mentorship program. As one of the 14 participants, I will be continuously adding new projects here, showcasing the skills and knowledge I will be acquiring throughout the program.

The main purpose of this repository will be to track my progress, demonstrate my learning journey, and provide a portfolio of my work. Each project will be meticulously documented, highlighting objectives, technologies used, and key learnings.

Stay tuned for updates as I embark on this exciting mentorship journey.
